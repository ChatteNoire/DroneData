# DroneData

Images for "quadcopter" and "syma drone" were scrapped from Google images.  

To avoid possible duplicates of quadcopters & syma drone, I flipped the images for syma drone vertically.  



# Annotating Fun

I'm using LabelImg.  
https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg

Follow installation instructions. I'm using Python 3 + Qt5, but idk if it matters.
For labelImg > data > predefinedclasses.txt, you can get rid of the cat, dog, etc. and just put "drone" since we're only having 1 class.

There's like probably 1175 images.  ಠ_ಠ
